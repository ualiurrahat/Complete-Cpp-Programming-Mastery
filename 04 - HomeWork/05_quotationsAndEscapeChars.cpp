/**
 * @file 05_quotationsAndEscapeChars.cpp
 * @brief Demonstrates proper syntax, escape characters, and string printing.
 *
 * @details
 * Corrects common beginner errors:
 * - Missing semicolons
 * - Wrong header (<stream instead of <iostream>)
 * - Incorrect use of quotes in strings
 * - Unreachable code after return
 *
 * Shows how to use \" to include quotes in strings.
 *
 * Expected output:
 * work smart not hard
 * Children must be taught how to think, not what to think
 * We worry about what a child will become "tomorrow", yet we forget that he is someone today
 * Children are not things to be molded, but are people to be unfolded
 * Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children.
 * It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men
 * Children need models rather than critics
 * Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them
 * Children are our most valuable resource
