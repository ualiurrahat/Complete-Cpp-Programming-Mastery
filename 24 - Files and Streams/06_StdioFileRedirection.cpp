/**
 * @file 06_StdioFileRedirection.cpp
 * @brief Demonstrates redirecting standard input/output to files using freopen.
 *
 * This file introduces the `freopen` function to redirect standard input (`stdin`) and output (`stdout`) to files.
 *
 * New Topics Introduced:
 * - **freopen Function**: Syntax: `FILE* freopen(const char* filename, const char* mode, FILE* stream)`. Redirects a standard stream (e.g., `stdin`, `stdout`) to a file. Modes include `"rt"` (read text), `"wt"` (write text).
 * - **Use Case**: Useful in competitive programming to read input from a file and write output to a file without changing the codeâ€™s `cin`/`cout` logic.
 * - **Standard Streams**: `stdin` (standard input), `stdout` (standard output), and `stderr` (standard error) are C-style file streams that can be redirected.
 *
 * The program redirects `stdin` to read from "read_file.txt" and `stdout` to write to "my_output.txt". Note: This is a minimal example; actual I/O operations are not shown.
