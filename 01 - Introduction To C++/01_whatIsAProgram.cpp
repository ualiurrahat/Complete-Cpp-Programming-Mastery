 * @details
 * This file does not execute any program. It is purely theoretical and serves as the foundation
 * for beginners to understand what a "program" means in the context of computers.
 *
 * We begin with an analogy — a Simple Calculator — to introduce the concept of a "program" as a
 * sequence of instructions, and understand the role of a programming language in writing those instructions.

// ---------------------- Theory: What is a Program? ----------------------
/*
    Imagine you are using a simple calculator.

    ● What do you do?
        ○ Read number 1 (e.g., 3)
        ○ Read operation (e.g., +)
        ○ Read number 2 (e.g., 5)
        ○ Press Equal (=)
        ○ You get the result: 8

    This process is a set of clear, step-by-step instructions.

    ✅ Definition:
        A program is a set of instructions given to a computer to perform a specific task.

    For example, a "program" could be:
        - Read a number
        - Multiply it by 2
        - Add 1
        - Show the result

    Just like the calculator follows your instructions,
    a computer follows your program instructions exactly as written.
*/

// ---------------------- Theory: Programming Language ----------------------
/*
    ● To write these instructions, we use a *programming language*.

    ● C++ is one such programming language that helps you communicate with the computer.

    ● Example (in plain English vs in C++):

        Plain English:
            Read a number.
            Display 2 * number + 1.

        In C++:
            int number;
            cin >> number;
            cout << 2 * number + 1;

    ● But to make the computer understand this,
      it must be written in a specific *format* that follows syntax rules.
