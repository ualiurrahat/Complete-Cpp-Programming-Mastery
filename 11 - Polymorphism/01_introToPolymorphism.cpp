 * @brief Introduction to Polymorphism in C++.
 *
 * Polymorphism means "one thing, many forms".
 * It can be categorized into:
 *
 * 1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Early Binding):
 *    - Function Overloading
 *    - Operator Overloading
 *
 * 2. Run-time Polymorphism (Late Binding):
 *    - Function Overriding (using virtual functions)
 *
 * This example only documents the concept of polymorphism.
